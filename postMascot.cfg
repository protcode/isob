#The isobarQuant package processes data from
#.raw files acquired on Thermo Scientific Orbitrap / QExactive / Fusion
#instrumentation working in  HCD / HCD or CID / HCD fragmentation modes.
#It creates an .hdf5 file into which are later parsed the results from
#Mascot searches. From these files protein groups are inferred and quantified.
